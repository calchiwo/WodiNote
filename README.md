# WodiNote 📝

Your private, offline, end-to-end encrypted notes app.

WodiNote is a secure notes application built to keep your thoughts truly private. All notes are fully offline and encrypted using AES-256-GCM, so only you can access them. No cloud storage, no leaks, no compromises.

## About Me

Hi! I’m Caleb Chikanka Wodi, a self-taught coder who started learning programming using my mum’s phone. WodiNote started as WodiWebify, and now it’s a fully polished notes app designed to give you total privacy and control over your information.

Big dreams start small 😎, and this is just the beginning.
